## Code Coverage
*Frameworks and tools that enable collection of code coverage metrics for test suites.*

* [Clover](https://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/overview) - Proprietary code coverage tool by Atlassian that relies on source-code instrumentation, instead of bytecode instrumentation.
* [Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) - Relies on offline (or static) bytecode instrumentation and class loading to collect code coverage metrics; GPLv2 licensed.
* [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/) - Framework that enables collection of code coverage metrics, using both offline and runtime bytecode instrumentation; prominently used by EclEmma, the Eclipse code-coverage plugin.
