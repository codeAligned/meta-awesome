## Bean Mapping
*Frameworks that ease bean mapping.*

* [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/) - Mapper that copies data from one object to another, using annotations, API or XML configuration.
* [JMapper](http://jmapper-framework.github.io/jmapper-core/) - Using byte code manipulation for lightning fast mapping. Supporting annotations, API or XML configuration.
* [MapStruct](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct) - Code generator which simplifies mappings between different bean types, based on a convention over configuration approach.
* [ModelMapper](https://github.com/jhalterman/modelmapper) - ModelMapper is an intelligent object mapping library that automatically maps objects to each other.
* [Orika](https://github.com/orika-mapper/orika) - Orika is a Java Bean mapping framework that recursively copies (among other capabilities) data from one object to another.
* [Selma](https://github.com/xebia-france/selma) - Stupid Simple Statically Linked Mapper. Selma is an Annotation Processor Based bean mapper.
