## Native
*For working with platform-specific native libraries.*

* [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) - Work with native libraries without writing JNI. Also provides interfaces to common system libraries.
* [JNR](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi) - Work with native libraries without writing JNI. Also provides interfaces to common system libraries. Same goals as JNA, but faster, and serves as the basis for the upcoming [Project Panama](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/).
* [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) - Provides efficient and easy access to native C++.
