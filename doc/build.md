## Build
*Tools which handle the build cycle and dependencies of an application.*

* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - Declarative build and dependency management which favors convention over configuration. It might be preferable to Apache Ant which uses a rather procedural approach and can be difficult to maintain.
* [Bazel](http://bazel.io) - Build tool from Google that builds code quickly and reliably.
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) - Incremental builds which are programmed via Groovy instead of declaring XML. Works well with Maven's dependency management.
